# object_segmentation

This is a template for a Python Machine Learning project with the following features:

* [Weights and Biases](wandb.ai) support, for experiment tracking and visualization
* [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) support, for configuration management
* [Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) support, for training and logging

In addition, it contains all the good features from the original version of this repository (and is a proper Python package):

* Installable via `pip install`. Anyone can point directly to this Github repository and install your project, either as a regular dependency or as an editable one.
* Uses the new [PEP 518, officially-recommended pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) structure for defining project structure and dependencies (instead of requirements.txt)
* Nice, static documentation website support, using mkdocs-material. Structure can be found in `docs/`
* `black` support by default, which is an opinionated code formatting tool
* `pytest` support, which will automatically run tests found in the `tests/` directory
* `mypy` support, for optional typechecking of type hints
* `pre-commit` support, which runs various formatting modifiers on commit to clean up your dirty dirty code automatically.
* Github Actions support, which runs the following:
    * On a Pull Request: install dependencies, run style checks, run Python tests
    * After merge: same a Pull Request, but also deploy the docs site to the projects Github Pages URL!!!!

All that needs doing is replacing all occurances of `object_segmentation` and `object-segmentation` with the name of your package(including the folder `src/object_segmentation`), the rest should work out of the box!

## Installation

First, we'll need to install platform-specific dependencies for Pytorch. See [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for more details. For example, if we want to use CUDA 11.8 with Pytorch 2.

```bash

pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118/

```

Then, we can install the package itself:

```bash

pip install -e ".[develop,notebook]"

```

Then we install pre-commit hooks:

```bash

pre-commit install

```
